It hasn’t been a better time to grab your AirPods and start listening. Amazon’s latest entertainment offering is a great bundle for commuters, those living the WFH home and anyone who loves a good book and a good playlist. Available now, users eligible for a free trial can benefit from three months free of Audible Premium Plus (which is normally $14.95 per month) and three months free of Amazon Music Unlimited (which is normally priced at $7.99 per month). Yeah, it’s pretty great. Why Audible Premium Plus? You can enjoy original audiobooks, bestselling titles like The Song of Achilles and Where The Crawdads Sing, podcasts, meditation programs and sleep tracks. Not sold yet? With this deluxe Audible offering, you’ll also receive one free title per month from an extended list of bestsellers and new releases (which is yours to keep forever). Now, for Amazon Music Unlimited. Nobody likes ads in between jamming to Drake and Ariana Grande, so you’ll have access to 75 million songs without interruptions. You can listen offline with unlimited skips and follow your favorite podcasts, too. Those interested must be eligible for a free trial. Customers can cancel any time; after the three-month free trial periods, users will be billed at full price for each subscription). Check out the New York Post Shopping section for more content.
